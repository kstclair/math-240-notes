# More with joint and conditional distributions  {#sec-more-joint-dist}

We will explore strategies for deriving the distribution of a function of a two (or more) random variables. Then we return to thinking conditionally (first introduced in @sec-think-cond) to see how to define a conditional pdf/pmf probability model. 

Make sure to review our [week 8 schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrtZ7JiEBz_r4XMC7Eib2ObRZpGSXkg2fVV1h8YrnUw/edit?usp=sharing).



## Day 21 {.unnumbered}

- What to read: Read sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4

- Learning objectives: These sections will help you
  - derive the pdf of a minimum or maximum 
  - derive the pmf/pdf of a sum of two independent RV using a convolution of functions
  
- After reading, take reading [quiz 17](https://forms.gle/KsqVyoKtsQLFrZcs5)

  
### Sections 8.2 {.unnumbered}

Key terminology to know:

  - [ ] order statistics
  - [ ] inequalities for mins and maxs

Comments: 

- Focus on material involving the min $X_{(1)}$ and max $X_{(n)}$ order statistics. 
- You can skim the proof of the beta distribution for general $X_{(k)}$ for $1 < k < n$ when your sample is iid uniform. (pages 333-334)


### Sections 8.3 {.unnumbered}

Key terminology to know:

  - [ ] convolution of two functions

Comments: 

- The convolution method of finding the pdf of $X+Y$ is an example of a CDF transformation method (i.e. find the CDF then differentiate to find PDF)
- Review section 4.4.1 equation 4.7 for review of the analogous discrete version of 8.3. 


### Sections 8.4 {.unnumbered}

Comments: 

- This section reviews both how to use geometry to compute probabilities from uniform pdfs and use of the CDF method to find PDF for a function of two RV.
- You can skim 8.23 (Buffon's needle problem is fun but you won't necessarily see trig calculations in hw/exam problems!)


## Day 22 {.unnumbered}

- What to read: Read sections 4.8, 9.1, 9.2

- Learning objectives: These sections will help you
  - derive conditional pmf/pdf from joint and marginal models
  - apply Bayes formula to conditional pmf/pdf
  
- After reading, take reading [quiz 18](https://forms.gle/aoCcCr7x9s8o6Uhk8)

  
### Sections 4.3, 9.1, and 9.2  {.unnumbered}

Key terminology to know:

  - [ ] conditional pmf
  - [ ] conditional pdf
  - [ ] Bayes formula for pdf

Comments: 

- We will cover expected value in 4.8.1 on Day 23. 
- Take care when deriving conditional pmf/pdf. E.g the pdf $f(y \mid x)$ of $Y \mid X=x$ is a function of $y$ and $x$ is a constant. 




## Day 23 {.unnumbered}

- What to read: Read sections 9.3, 9.5

- Learning objectives: These sections will help you
