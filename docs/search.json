    "text": "What to read: Read sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.8 to see the generalization of property #3.\nLearning goals:\n\ndefine basic probability and set theory terminology\ndefine fundamental properties of probability\n\n\n\nSection 1.1\nKey terminology to know:\n\nSample space \\(\\Omega\\)\nOutcome \\(\\omega\\): this can also be called an element\nEvent \\(A\\), \\(B\\), …\n\nNotes:\nThe sample space for a random experiment is the list of all possible outcomes. To define a sample space, start by thinking about how to define a couple individual outcomes and then generalize this to all outcomes. If there are a large or infinite number of outcomes, then you can use a “…” to show that a pattern will continue (like Examples 1.3 and 1.4).\nThere may not be a unique way to define a sample space and outcomes for a random experiment. For example, one may chose to define the sample space for Example 1.3 as just the number of votes for Yolanda \\[\\Omega = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\dotsc, 999, 1000\\}\\]. But all the outcomes in a sample space must define unique possibilities for a random experiment (i.e. they are mutually exclusive, section 1.4).\n“Complex” random experiments are often composed of simpler experiments. Example 1.2 is an example of this as we define one outcome for two dice rolls as the joint outcome of two individual die rolls. Similar for the sample space for three coin flips. In scenarios where the individual simpler experiments have equally likely outcomes, the outcomes in the more complex sample space (e.g. two dice rolls, three coin flips) are also equally likely outcomes.\n\n\nSection 1.2-1.3\nKey ideas to know:\n\nrelative frequency interpretation of probability\nprobability function and its essential properties\n\nNotes:\nMake sure you can put the probability function properties into words: (1) means probabilities can’t be negative, (2) means something in the sample space has to happen with probability 1 and (3) means the probability of an event is just the sum of the probabilities of outcomes that make up that event.\n\n\nSection 1.4 + 1.8\nKey set theory ideas to know\n\ncomplement \\(A^c\\) (not \\(A\\))\nunion \\(A \\cup B\\) (at least one \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) or both)\nintersection \\(A \\cap B = AB\\) (both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\))\n\\((AB)^c = A^c \\cup B^c\\) (at most one)\n\\((A \\cup B)^c = A^cB^c\\) (neither)\n\\(AB^c\\) (\\(A\\) but not \\(B\\))\nsubset \\(\\subseteq\\)\nmutually exclusive/disjoint events\nVenn diagram\nempty set \\(\\emptyset\\)\n\nNotes:\nThe first six ideas create a new event out of one or more events (think addition, subtraction, etc). Subset, mutually exclusive and Venn diagrams tells us relational information about events (think less than, etc). The empty set is a set that has no outcomes (think zero).\nKey probability properties to know\n\nAddition rule for mutually exclusive events (only add probability of events when they are mutually exclusive)\nGeneral addition rule (events do not need to be mutually exclusive)\nComplement rule\n\nNotes:\nThe addition rule properties are used to find the probability of a union of two or more events. When events are mutually exclusive, we just add the individual event probabilities. Make sure that you assess whether events are mutually exclusive before simply adding their probabilities.\nWhen events are not mutually exclusive, you start by adding event probabilities but then you need to subtract out the probability of the overlap (intersection) between events. The inclusion/exclusion rule is an extension of property (3) (eq. 1.3).\nThe complement rule along with the addition rule is useful for computing the probability of neither \\(A\\) nor \\(B\\): \\[\nP(A^c B^c) = 1 - P(A \\cap B)\n\\]",
