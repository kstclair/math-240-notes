# More with joint and conditional distributions  {#sec-limit-thms}

We will explore strategies for deriving the distribution of a function of a two (or more) random variables. Then we return to thinking conditionally (first introduced in @sec-think-cond) to see how to define a conditional pdf/pmf probability model.
