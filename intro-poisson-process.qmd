# Poisson Process  {#sec-intro-cont-rv}

Make sure to review our [week 6 schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qnz5t0OptIaeS-C-bjW4AMzgbrhckJPz4PuElSgGPac/edit?usp=sharing).



## Day 16 {.unnumbered}

- What to read: Read section 7.3 through page 299.

- Learning objectives: These sections will help you
  - understand what a Poisson process is
  - see how "interarrival" or waiting times between Poisson events can be modeled by exponential or gamma distributed random variables
  
- After reading, take reading [quiz 13](https://forms.gle/uAfSZ3NQmiX7MorE8)

  

### Section 7.3 {.unnumbered}

Key terminology to know:

  - [ ] Poisson process with $N_t \sim Pois(\lambda t)$
  - [ ] Interarrival times $E_k \sim Exp(\lambda)$
  - [ ] Time until the $nth$ event $S_n \sim Gamma(n,\lambda)$
  
Comments: 

- You can skim/skip the proof on page 296 (up to example 7.15). This proof of the Poisson process model relies on joint pdf which we haven't covered yet. 

- There is a **typo** on page 298: The *Stationary increments*  property should state that "For all $0 < s,t$, ..." instead of $0 < s < t$
